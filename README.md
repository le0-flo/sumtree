# sumtree
This is the solution to the sumtree problem that was given in a challenge during the italian coding olympiads (OIS 2022-2023)

It is a bit late indeed because during the challenge itself i wasn't able to crack it down but now i tried it and managed to code some and make it work.
Feel free to comment and suggest improvements to the code

## The problem text is in the sumtree (IT).pdf file
